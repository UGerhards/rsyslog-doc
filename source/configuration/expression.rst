Expressions in rsyslog
======================

Rsyslog supports expressions at a growing number of places. So far, they
are supported for filtering messages.

Expression support is provided by RainerScript. Please see the
`RainerScript documentation <rainerscript.html>`_ for more details.

C-like comments (/\* some comment \*/) are supported **inside** the
expression, but not yet in the rest of the configuration file.
